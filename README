This module takes an rss feed from www.fbrss.com where you get your facebook feed. After processing the feed it first represents the content in a block and then sends the content to the db.

__________________________________________________________________________

You can get your facebook rss from www.fbrss.com. Or at least until they change it again

Once you have your rss follow this complex process to configure this advanced module.

1: go to the path admin/settings/set_facebook_rss

2: copy past your rss.

3: hit submit

(step 3 probably wasn't needed but it seemed so boring)
